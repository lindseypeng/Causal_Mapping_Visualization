We are currently in the initial phase of the project. Our focus is on collecting a list of algorithms and creating their visualizations. This stage involves:

- Identifying key algorithms that are essential for understanding various concepts.
- Developing visual representations for these algorithms to make learning more intuitive.
- Establishing the data requirements to translate information into various algorithms.
- Exploring connections between different algorithms to provide new insights.


### Visualization
- **Basic Component**: The core element is the visualization of algorithms.
- **Library Creation**: Develop a small seed of algorithms accompanied by their visual representations.
- **Data Requirements**: Determine the requirements to translate information into various algorithms. Explore if these connections provide new insights.
- **Reference Resources**: Utilize resources like StatsQuest to guide these visualizations.
- **Causal Inference**: Incorporate elements from causal inference to enhance understanding.
- **Complex Concepts**: Identify and visualize hard-to-learn concepts to facilitate easier comprehension.

### Hypothesizing and Contextualizing
Facilitate users in hypothesizing about different situations and use AI to generate relevant data for them.

## Second Stage: Education and Community Contribution
- Provide the community with basic programming lessons and methods to contribute to the project.
- Encourage individuals seeking career changes and students to contribute by adding examples they are interested in learning. Empower them to use this tool to create their own learning templates.
