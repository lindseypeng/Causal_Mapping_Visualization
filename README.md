# Project Name

## VALUES
We aim to empower individuals to believe they can learn and understand anything deeply. Our goal is to extend beyond academic necessities to encompass ideas that are vital for making informed life decisions.

## First Stage: Building the Backbone

### Visualization
- **Basic Component**: The core element is the visualization of algorithms.
- **Library Creation**: Develop a small seed of algorithms accompanied by their visual representations.
- **Data Requirements**: Determine the requirements to translate information into various algorithms. Explore if these connections provide new insights.
- **Reference Resources**: Utilize resources like StatsQuest to guide these visualizations.
- **Causal Inference**: Incorporate elements from causal inference to enhance understanding.
- **Complex Concepts**: Identify and visualize hard-to-learn concepts to facilitate easier comprehension.

### Hypothesizing and Contextualizing
Facilitate users in hypothesizing about different situations and use AI to generate relevant data for them.

## Second Stage: Education and Community Contribution
- Provide the community with basic programming lessons and methods to contribute to the project.
- Encourage individuals seeking career changes and students to contribute by adding examples they are interested in learning. Empower them to use this tool to create their own learning templates.
